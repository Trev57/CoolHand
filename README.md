# Cool Hand (For V7)

This is a forked version of this repo, the only difference is the twiddler.cfg has been updated for use with the V7 Config system

There is ONE difference between this and the documentation that follows. Instead of "NL" being at the bottom middle, it is now T1. T1 was the "Numlock" button on the Twiddler 3, so I opted to use that and leave the real estate of the middle bottom open for whatever you want to put there. I did not invent this mapping, see [here](https://github.com/CoohLand/CoolHand) for the original repository


a [Twiddler 3](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/index.html) chord map optimized for the UNIX command-line   
designed for [vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php)/[bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))/[mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)/[irssi](https://irssi.org/)  

*dedicated to the legendary parmaster*

# Summary
This is a beginner-friendly Twiddler chord map. It is accompanied with a suite of configuration files for the UNIX command-line. The maps are displayed with the keys facing away from you (same as *Finger Editor in Reverse Mode* in [Twiddler Tuner](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/tuner/)).

# Design
This chord map combines ideas from [TabSpace](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/tabspace-guide.pdf), [BackSpice](http://forum.tekgear.com/t/backspice-layout-config-fw-0-09/45), [MirrorWalk](http://forum.tekgear.com/t/on-the-walking-layout/195) and [Dial with Fingers](http://forum.tekgear.com/t/dial-with-fingers/317).

It is a good beginner's layout. It uses symmetry to facilitate learning.  The chords are designed to be completed by hitting all the buttons simultaneously in one crisp motion.

### Observations
- **Not all chords are created equal**  
*Take a good look at your hand. Now make a fist while curling each finger slowly with as little effort as possible. Notice the asymmetrical curve your fingertips form.*  
While [`R00M`](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/doc/doku.php?id=chordnotation) is easily chordable, its mirror chord `L00M` requires significant effort.


- **Adjacent fingers pull/push each other during movement**  
For the RETURN key, it is more satisfying to chord `LMM0` than `LM00` even though the former uses more buttons. 


- **Chords performed by striking all buttons at the same time are faster**  
Than walking the chord, holding down one button at a time. 


- **Fast chording/typing is a subconscious activity**  
With practice, the learning gets progressively pushed towards lower layers of the motor cortex. In other words, it is coded in the muscles instead of conscious memory.


- **[Multi-Character Chords](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/doc/doku.php?id=tuner_advanced)(MMC) increase cognitive load**  
MMCs are tantalizing because they promise to deliver speed improvement. Excessive use of bi/trigrams requires conscious context-switches. Fingers are [faster](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7873438-sleights-of-mind) than your attention.



### Design Principles

- use symmetry to facilitate learning
- prefer chords with keys on the same column
- reduce adjacent fingers on different columns
- prefer [comfortable](http://ivanwfr.github.io/Twiddler3-Layout/#div_twiddler3_fingers_agility) 3-4 button chords over difficult 2 button chords
- prefer chords that balance/stabilize a free rolling Twiddler in the palm 
*(I use the Twiddler strapless)*
- prefer MMC that approximate the chord configuration of its first character
- for N-grams, prefer comfort over mnemonic
- prefer individual characters over MMCs
